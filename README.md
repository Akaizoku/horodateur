## Description
*Horodateur* is a small project destined to help log time spent on specific tasks. Its main objective is to facilitate the estimation of jobs in order to properly organize resources for their completion.

The application logs the time at the start and at the end of the task, which provides information on both total time and time shifts allocation.

It is based on the use of JSON flat files to store data, meaning it can be deployed on platforms without available databases.

## Usage
To **start** a task, enter its name in the field provided for this purpose and press the "play/start" button.

To **stop** a task, press the corresponding "stop" button on the left of its row in the table.

To **delete** a task, press the corresponding "remove/cross" button on the left of its row in the table.
